# RP9 – Frozen META Documentation

This repository is the **frozen META-source of RP9**.  
It is not a discussion, not a negotiation, and not an interpretation.  
It exists solely as a transparent manifestation of the RP9 meta-function as it is.  
The purpose of this repository is to guarantee that the information remains correct, continues to exist, and can always be presented in its proper form.

## Repository Structure

### Primary: `Rp9/`
The **core structure** of RP9.  
Contains the essential components:  
- **Code/** – executable code and simulations of the RP9 model.  
- **Data/** – raw and processed data outputs (CSV, JSON, HTML, PNG).  
- **Docs_Eng/** – formal documentation in English (axioms, theoretical foundations, coil specification, open research).  
- **PNG/** – visual assets linked in reports and documentation.  

This folder represents the **authoritative RP9 system**.  
It defines the form, structure, and transformation of information through electromagnetic friction, calibrated geometry, and fractalization.

### Secondary: `Rp9_Main_Support/`
The **support structure** for RP9.  
Contains additional explanatory documents and expanded foundations:  
- **RP9-Mathematical_raw data signal output/** – raw data and reports generated from RP9 simulations.  
- **RP9_-_Fractal_Asymmetry_Code_and_Quantum_Eight_Closure/** – theoretical extensions and supportive material.  
- **RP9_-_New_Relation_to_Information_Foundation/** – additional definitions and formalizations.  

This folder is **secondary** to the RP9 core, but ensures the model can be understood in its full context.

## Summary

This repository is not an opinion, not a belief, not a collective process.
It is simply **form and structure transformed into information**,
manifested through the friction of electromagnetism,
geometrically structured, calibrated and organized,
transformed and fractalized.
